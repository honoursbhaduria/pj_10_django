# pj_10_django
We will build a simple Django app that shortens long URLs. Users will enter a URL on the homepage, submit it, and instantly get a shortened link on the next page. Weâ€™ll set up the Django project, connect to Bitly with an access token, handle user input, and display the results all in a clean, easy-to-follow way.
